Sounds of Quarentine:

For my final consolidation project I decided to create a new soundscape narrative that depicts the sounds of quarentine. This is what an actual day consisted of for me being couped up in my Oakland apartment during the Corona virus pandemic . Sometimes its the littlest things that make my day, and help me not to get down when stuck inside all the time. I hope you enjoy.
